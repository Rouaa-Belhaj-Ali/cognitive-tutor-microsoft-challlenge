# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Inspiration
The inspiration for Cognitive Tutor stemmed from the desire to enhance personalized learning experiences through the power of artificial intelligence. As educators and students face diverse challenges in the learning process, we envisioned a solution that adapts to individual needs, providing real-time assistance and tailored tutoring.

### What it does
Cognitive Tutor is an AI-powered educational assistant that helps students learn more effectively by providing real-time, personalized responses to their questions. Leveraging advanced natural language processing and machine learning algorithms from Azure OpenAI, it delivers clear and accurate explanations across a wide range of subjects. Throughout this project, I learned a lot about Microsoft CosmosDB, appreciating its scalability and performance for handling large datasets. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I couldn't integrate CosmosDB into the app. However, this experience highlighted the extensive suite of powerful tools and services Microsoft offers, such as Azure Cognitive Services and Azure Machine Learning, which significantly enhance the development of intelligent applications.

### How we built it
We built Cognitive Tutor using a combination of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques. During the submission period, I focused on optimizing the functionality of Cognitive Tutor using Azure OpenAI. I refined the interaction flow between students and the AI assistant, ensuring more accurate responses and a smoother user experience. Additionally, I enhanced the user interface to improve usability and accessibility, making it more intuitive for learners. These updates were aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of the AI-powered educational tool in providing personalized learning support.

### Challenges we ran into
I was pressed by the deadline, trying to make this project as creative and suitable for this amazing challenge as possible, aligned with the abilities and skills of other professional developers. I spent a lot of time on Microsoft Learn, as I wanted to gain as much knowledge as possible. Although this was a very important step, it took me a significant amount of time, especially with Phase 1 and Phase 2. I wished I had more time to develop the project further and present it with a much better interface and functionalities. Nonetheless, this experience was incredibly valuable, and I learned a great deal from it. I now understand what I am missing and what I need to improve.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

###What we learned
Throughout the development of Cognitive Tutor, we learned the importance of integrating various AI technologies to create a seamless and effective learning platform. Understanding user needs and feedback was crucial in refining our algorithms and enhancing user experience

### What's next for Cognitive Tutor
developing more functionnalities also more microsoft services specially leveraging and including Cosmosdb.
